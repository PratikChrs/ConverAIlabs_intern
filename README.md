# Hinglish Voice-AI â€” Mini Fine-Tuning Project

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

We built a Voice-AI assistant that understands and responds in Hinglish (Hindi + English mix).  
Since the Gemini API doesn't currently allow direct model fine-tuning, we used **few-shot prompting** to simulate fine-tuning behavior.
